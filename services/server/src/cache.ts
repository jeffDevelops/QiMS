database!

applications!

If you'd like to try qiMS with an existing dataset, we'd recommend either

1) Schema Readonly Mode, which disables the ability to migrate the database, or
2) making a copy of the existing database by restoring an empty database with a
dump from the one you'd like to experiment with.

1) Schema Readonly Mode
-----------------------
For this use case, qiMS disables schema revision and will never migrate
the database. The qiMS admin UI performs the same as it would in
production--only content / data can be managed, and revisions to models
and relationships are not made available to anyone.

This option is good for adding non-technical administrative functionality
to existing systems, or migrating existing client applications to
GraphQL networking implementations.
